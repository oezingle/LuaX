---@field size_hints { user_position: integer, user_size: integer, program_position: integer, program_size: integer, max_width: integer, max_height: integer, min_width: integer, min_height: integer, width_inc: integer, height_inc: integer } A table with size hints of the client.
---@field motif_wm_hints nil|{ functions: { all: boolean?, resize: boolean?, move: boolean?, minimize: boolean?, maxmimize: boolean? }?, decorations: { all: boolean?, border: boolean?, resizeh: boolean?, title: boolean?, menu: boolean?, minimize: boolean?, maximize: boolean? }?, input_mode: string?, status: { tearoff_window: boolean? }? } The motif WM hints of the client. This is nil if the client has no motif hints. Otherwise, this is a table that contains the present properties. Note that awesome provides these properties as-is and does not interpret them for you. For example, if the function table only has “resize” set to true, this means that the window requests to be only resizable, but asks for the other functions not to be able. If however both “resize” and “all” are set, this means that all but the resize function should be enabled
