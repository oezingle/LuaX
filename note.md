### TODO
- outside state changes somehow
- Remove any mention of XML, for XML isn't cool and good enough for React-like syntax (slaxml tried its best but no implicit props)
- contexts
- text parsing option - remove newlines, use only double-newlines as newlines (similar to markdown)
- test FC that sometimes returns Fragment and sometimes returns single child - how does NativeElement respond?
- wiki
- move spec to spec/src/* so i can write helpers and move stupid out of src/
