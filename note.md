# The big plan

- write react-like features
    - function components
    - use_state, use_effect
        - maybe contexts?
    - figure out state management
    - create_element
        - children should be rendered i guess.
    - maybe helper function generates class instance
        - props as statically checked

- outside state changes somehow

- write library that wraps awful components to this library

- XML support
    - xml code snippets
    - lua loader -> convert .x.lua to plain lua
